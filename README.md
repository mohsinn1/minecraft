# Minecraft Cloned

## Overview

This project implements a Minecraft-like block world in Godot 4, complete with a dynamic day/night cycle, crafting, and robust player controls. You can move, jump, place and break blocks, craft items, and accelerate the passage of time. This README will guide you through the controls..

## How to Use

- **Movement**: Use W/A/S/D to move and Spacebar to jump.
- **Blocks**: Use E and Q to cycle through block types. Place blocks with the Left Mouse Button and break them with the Right Mouse Button.(A block takes 2 hits to break)
- **Crafting**: For the crafting label, use Right/Left Arrow to change recipes. Press C to craft the currently selected recipe.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: The game world simulates a 24-hour cycle. Hold T to rapidly advance time for testing sunrise, sunset, and night.

## Day/Night Cycle
I also added a day and night cycle which updates the light and the sky in the world in real time.
